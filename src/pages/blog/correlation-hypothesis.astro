        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In this analysis, we explore the correlation between the number of brown drinks consumed and snoring frequency. Using Python's pandas and matplotlib libraries, we visualize this relationship to test our hypothesis.
        </p>

        <h2>The Code</h2>
        <p>Here's the Python code used for the analysis:</p>
        <pre><code>import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Create the DataFrame
data = {'Brown Drinks with Coke': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
        'Snores per Minute': [5, 10, 15, 20, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Plot the data
df.plot(title='Correlation between Drinks and Snores For Colby',
        x='Brown Drinks with Coke',
        y='Snores per Minute',
        style='-',
        xlim=[0, 6],
        ylim=[0, 35],
        figsize=[5, 5],
        color='blue',
        xlabel='Number of Drinks',
        ylabel='Snores per Minute')</code></pre>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            The visualization shows a clear positive correlation between the number of brown drinks consumed and snoring frequency. As the number of drinks increases, there's a proportional increase in snores per minute.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear relationship between variables</li>
            <li>Consistent increase in snoring with each additional drink</li>
            <li>Range: 5-30 snores per minute</li>
            <li>Drink consumption: 1-5 units</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The data suggests a strong positive correlation between brown drink consumption and snoring frequency. This relationship appears to be linear, with each additional drink corresponding to an increase of approximately 5-7 snores per minute.
