        <h2>New Role and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
            I'm excited to announce my new position as a Data Analyst at Keeley Companies in St. Louis, Missouri. In this role, I'm part of a crucial data migration project, transitioning from SAGE 300 CRE to CMiC.
        </p>

        <h2>The Data Migration Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            Our team is handling complex data migration tasks that involve:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processing large-scale datasets exceeding 200,000 records per department</li>
            <li>Conducting thorough data analysis to identify trends and patterns</li>
            <li>Detecting anomalies and incorrect information in existing data</li>
            <li>Implementing ETL processes for data cleansing and transformation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Analysis Approach</h2>
        <p>
            The migration process involves several key steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extracting comprehensive datasets from SAGE 300 CRE</li>
            <li>Analyzing data quality and consistency across departments</li>
            <li>Identifying patterns and potential data issues</li>
            <li>Developing ETL solutions for data correction</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact and Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            Our systematic approach to data migration is yielding significant benefits:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved data accuracy through thorough validation</li>
            <li>Reduced errors in subsequent data uploads</li>
            <li>Streamlined transition process to CMiC</li>
            <li>Enhanced data quality for future operations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>
            This project represents a significant step in modernizing Keeley Companies' data infrastructure. Through careful analysis and systematic ETL processes, we're ensuring a smooth transition while maintaining data integrity and improving overall data quality.
